# Article Lifecycle and Workflow

1. A journalist creates an article and publishes it to a publisher or independently.
2. The independent articles are visible to readers, but the articles published to a publisher remains unpublished until editor approves.
3. The articles become visible to readers:
   - In the web application
   - Through the REST API
4. Readers only receive articles from journalists or publishers they are subscribed to.
